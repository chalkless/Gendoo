<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Gendoo</span>
(<span class="gendoo">Gen</span>e,
 <span class="gendoo">d</span>isease features
 <span class="gendoo">o</span>ntology-based
 <span class="gendoo">o</span>verview system) provides
the keywords of disease, drug, biological phenomena, and anatomy
associated with genes and diseases of your interest.
</p><p>
Gendoo utilizes a controlled vocabulary
MeSH (Medical Subject Headings) as keywords.
We are going to use Gene Ontology terms in addition to MeSH.
</p><p>
Gendoo accepts following items as input queries:
</p>
<ul>
 <li> Entrez Gene ID
 <li> gene name
 <li> OMIM ID
 <li> disease name (OMIM title)
 <li> keywords (MeSH terms): diseases, drugs, biological phenomena, and anatomy
</ul>

<p>
Gendoo currently uses descriptions of "title" and "alternative titles; symbols"
sections of OMIM for disease name, so that not all synonyms are included in the
dictionary such as "type 2 diabetes".
We will increase the synonyms by involving canonical names and synonyms (entry
terms) of corresponding MeSH terms, and extracting disease names from
MEDLINE and OMIM resources with text mining approach.
</p>

<p>
Gendoo generates two views as result: high-scoring lists and
hierarchical-tree view.

<img src="tree.png" alt="hierarchical-tree view" width="400" height="377"
     style="align: right; border: 0px;">
<p>
When input query is gene or disease name, candidate gene/OMIM list will
be generated because the same name is referred to by several diseases,
genes, and drugs.
Please choose the items of your interests.
</p>

<p>
When input query is keywords, high-scoring lists of associated genes
and diseases are generated.
</p><p>
The summary of searching process is as follows:

<h2>How to use Gendoo?</h2>

<h3>Gene/OMIM IDs -> Associated diseases, drugs, biological phenomena, and anatomies</h3>
<p>
Please input Entrez Gene/OMIM ID to ID form of each category.
</p>
<img src="from_id.png" alt="Input ID to ID form"
     width="330" height="241" style="border: 0px;">

<p>
When you want to input multiple IDs or names, please input 1 ID/name per line to ID form.
</p>
<img src="from_ids.png" alt="Input 1 ID per line"
     width="328" height="239" style="border: 0px;">

<p>
Please click "Search" after inputting IDs or names.
</p>

<p>
High-scoring lists will be generated.

     width="502" height="869" style="border: 0px;">

<p>
The significance of each association is illustrated by
assigning background color according to their
<span style="font-style: italic;">p</span>-value.
The scores are derived from frequency of documents co-occurring descriptions
of genes/diseases and assigned MeSH keywords.
</p>

<p>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Note:</span>
"Sum score" (Information Gain) means the significance of
association between "group" of genes or diseases and keywords.
Gendoo shows this score only as a reference because the sum score is calculated
briefly.
Gendoo uses information gain as score for calculation of
"sum score". The range of information gain is 0 to 1. The higher score means
the larger significance of association.
The score for group of diseases or genes should be derived from articles
referred to any disease or gene in the group.
However, the accurate calculation requires much time and machine power.
Gendoo presently calculate
sum scores by briefly summing up the information gain of each association
instead of accurate calculation.
To sum up <span style="font-style: italic;">p</span>-values
seem to be mathematically inconsistent as scores of genes and diseases groups.
(We received the suggestion that sum score is confusing, so that we will delete
the column in the next release.)

<p>
The values of
<span style="font-style: italic;">p</span>-value
and information gain
are shown
by putting mouse pointer on each cell.

<p>
Gendoo also generates hierarchical-tree view by clicking "Tree View" link.
</p>

Following figure is a sample of hierarchical-tree view.

<p>
Gendoo currently assigns colors to the keywords of high-scoring list and
hierarchical tree view in a differenct way. In high-scoring list, Gendoo
assigns the colors to "each association" between genes or diseases and
keywords, namely each cell of the table. On the other hand, in hierarchical
tree view, Gendoo assigns the color according to the score of "group" of
genes or diseases as sum score. We are modifying Gendoo programs to reduce
the difference of colors between these views, and we will consider
other way to assign colors to each keywords such as by their ranks.
